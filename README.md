This animated viz. replicated [this interesting animation](https://github.com/jgleeson/housing_analysis/blob/master/House_price_cycle.md), originally done in R, as practice in pandas data manipulation, and matplotlib figure customization/animation. 

The resulting figure (shown right) plots percentage change (average over three years) in average house price in English local areas against the ranked average house price at the beginning of the three year period. It demonstrates a 'ripple' effect, where expensive areas (high rank) see an increase in house price, with less expensive areas following in a later years in a 'wave' manner. 

Huge thanks to the original author for such a great project.
